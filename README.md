# VA NLP

VA NLP is a multi-class single-label Bayes classifier optimised to prototype conversation logic for virtual assistant projects (e.g Chatbots).

It can train a model using in-memory or localstorage with an intent model made up of intents and utterances. Once trained, it can then classify messages or documents where it will return the intent it is best matched to.

## Useage

```bash
yarn add va-nlp
```

### Conversation Logic

### Example


## Background

Based on Baye's Theorem of conditional probabilities, the Bayes approach to NLP is well researched and easy to use.

Formula for join probability
- p(A,B) = p(B|A)p(A)
= p(A,B) = p(A|B)p(B)

Baye's theorem is used to calculate P(A|B) given P(B|A)
